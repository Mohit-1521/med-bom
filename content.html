<p><strong>About Mediation Bombay 6.0</strong></p><p>Mediation Bombay 6.0 is a celebration of excellence and innovation in dispute resolution. Over five successful editions, it has grown into India’s premier mediation competition and remains the only one in the country to feature a unique tripartite finals format, simulating real-world disputes between parties, counsels, and mediators.</p><p>With international participation, including back-to-back wins by Singapore Management University, the competition serves as a bridge between Asian legal talent and the global ADR community. Hosted in Mumbai, Mediation Bombay continues to be a leading platform for aspiring mediators and negotiators worldwide.</p><p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p><p>At Mediation Bombay, we aim to nurture, foster, and enhance the growth and quality of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) practices in India. As young lawyers, it is rare to encounter a professional environment that genuinely embraces mediation with an open and accommodating mindset. Here, we strive to change the notion and perception of mediation. We seek to emphasize that speaking up is not interference, sharing perspectives isn't bias, and a mediator is far more than just a mere recorder or facilitator.</p><p><strong>About our university</strong></p><p>Founded in 2014, Maharashtra National Law University Mumbai is one of India’s youngest yet most dynamic National Law Universities.
